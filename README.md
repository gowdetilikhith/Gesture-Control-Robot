# Gesture-Control-Robot
Nowadays, robotics are becoming one of the most advanced in
the field of technology. The applications of robotics mainly
involve in automobiles, medical, construction, defense and also
used as a fire fighting robot to help the people from the fire
accident. But, controlling the robot with a remote or a switch is
quite complicated. So, a new project is developed that is, an
accelerometer based gesture control robot. The main goal of
this project is to control the movement of the robot with hand
gesture using accelerometer.accelerometer or transmitter
device depends upon the hand gesture. Through transmitter
device, a command is received and it is processed with the help
of microcontroller. This microcontroller gives signal to the
robot to move in the preferred direction. The basic working
principle of this robot set of the data signals of transmitting
device readings to the microcontroller fitted in the robot. The
preprogrammed microcontroller runs according to the
program, which make the robot work accordingly.
